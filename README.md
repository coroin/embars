##### Last updated v2.4.0 r1119 2013-05-08 0200Z

EmBars 2.x is the version-2 rewrite of the popular [MomentumBars](https://gitlab.com/coroin-ninja/bundle), created and released in February 2011 to the [BMT](https://futures.io/) Elite community.

MomentumBars was later re-released with a free and open-source license (specifically, the GNU-GPL) on the [coroin.com](https://coroin.com) website in July 2012. 

In December 2014, the project moved to git.coroin.com and makes available the VS project source files to encourage further development and collaboration.

In October 2016, the project moved to gitlab.com.
